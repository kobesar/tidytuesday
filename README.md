# tidytuesday

This is my tidytuesday repository where I'll have the code to the visuals I make for tidytuesday! I usually post these visuals on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/swingmisstake), so please check them out and follow me if you want!

For 3/1, we were given data about [Alternative fuel stations](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-03-01/readme.md) in the U.S. and Canada. I decided to make a map of the U.S. to show which states saw insane growth in the number of EV charging stations compared to other states, also showing which states lagged behind.
